# Terraria Potion Ingredient Helper Tool
Quick, hacky, helper tool for figuring out farming requirements for potions in Terraria.

CSV format for potions and ingredients can be found within:
`TerrariaPotionIngredientHelper/Terraria Potion Ingredients/Terraria Potion Ingredients/Data/`

Building and running the program results in a shopping list csv being created in a folder relative to the executable.
If Debug build - look in `bin\Debug\net6.0\Data`
